# Face-Recognition-Using-Open-CV-CNN
This project implements face recognition using OpenCV and CNNs. It involves detecting faces in images or video streams with OpenCV, training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate face recognition, and achieving real-time performance for authentication or surveillance purposes.
